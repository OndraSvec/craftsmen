# Craftsmen PWA

This is a craftsmen review progressive web app.

In combination with Ionic's mobile-first UI components, the app harnesses some of Angular's newer features,
such as deferrable views and standalone components, as well as reactive forms to handle user interaction.

It is made using:

- Typescript,
- Angular,
- Ionic,
- and Firebase
